just basically put this script in the folder where your steganographic jpgs are stored, run the script, and it will extract/save a *.txt file in the same folder.
make sure Stegosuite is installed first and you know the password for the file you want to extract.

stegx2 adds some features such as asking to install Stegosuite if it is not already installed, and offering to extract another file or exit at the end.
