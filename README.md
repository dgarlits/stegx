A GUI front end for Stegosuite. Make sure Stegosuite is installed first, then you can use stegx.deb to select a file to decrypt, export it as a *.txt file, and even read the file in the viewer.
For extra privacy, there is a "Clear" button that clears the GUI and deletes the *.txt file that was created.
